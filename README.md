# MyReads: A Book Lending App

MyReads is a book lending web app that provides 3 categories (called shelves) where user can place a book from a number of books under different categories and by various authors.

Think of it as a physical book-shelf with three compartments that helps you easily and quickly navigate to a book or books based on whether you're currently reading it (or them) or you have interest in reading (probably because it's written by a familiar author or the title is in sync with your knowledge field) or you have finshed read (say, to lend it out to a friend)

This application provides you with a landing page that holds the 3 shelves, "Currently Reading", "Want to Read", and "Read". Each shelved contains books as assigned by user.
Books can also be moved from shelf to shelf as desired by user.

MyReads gives user access to various books in several categories. These books can be accessed by navigating to the search page using the plus(+) button. The dropdown on each button can be used to move books from one shelf to another as desired by user.
